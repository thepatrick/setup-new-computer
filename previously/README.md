## Previously

This repo contained packages intended to be installed through tools such as [bootstrappr](https://github.com/munki/bootstrappr) or [installr](https://github.com/munki/installr). The writing has been on the wall for some time - binding to AD, managing certificates and profiles using scripts was becoming less viable, and under Big Sur this just doesn't really work anymore. I'm keeping these here in case they are useful to anyone who needs to do the same thing using MDM but needs to know the config files and what not that were edited.

Each directory should have a `README.md` that explains what it is.
